# Frontend dev Setup Process
``` 
cd CCW-Frontend 
npm install
npm run dev
```
# Run Test Cases

Run frontend first, then run testcases
cd CCW-Frontend
npm run cypress:open

Then chose Chrome browser and run all testcases.

This was done on my mac and hopefully you have your dependencies installed . . . which I didnt keep track of. Hopefully npm install does all the dependencies stuff for you
